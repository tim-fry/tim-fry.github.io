	<h2>about tim</h2>

<p>Tim is a twenty-something Computer Science graduate working on the sunny south coast of England.</p>

<div class="leftimg"><img src="about me.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Tim loves music, especially 'Lost Souls' by Doves but also a bit of almost anything with very little consistency.  You&#8217;ll recognise Tim at work because he&#8217;s the one with the headphones in constantly, the other end being plugged into his iPhone.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s a Southampton season ticket holder and spends every other Saturday afternoon from autumn through spring sitting in a plastic seat shouting and singing until he&#8217;s lost his voice.  He&#8217;ll also quite happily watch rugby union, cricket or athletics. Some people say he looks a bit like Tim Henman.</p>

<p>Tim also likes to think he has an eye for design, loves technology and once had a thing about collecting lights.  He gets hay fever in the summer and colds in the winter, which is a shame because he loves getting outside because the world is frankly a wonderful place.  If Tim were a fictional character, he would be Eeyore the Donkey with a gin habit.</p>
